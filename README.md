# WriteFree-FrontEnd
## Installation
1. ``` cd draftjs/```
2. ``` npm install```
3. ``` npm start```
4. Open localhost:3000/login
## Known Bugs
1. HTML/CSS gets inconsistent when you resize the window.
2. CovertToPDF doesn't work pefectly: it only works with background color, bold and italic.
3. TextToSpeech doesn't work consistently: it does not read the proper text sometimes. And it only works in Chrome.
4. Hyphenation functionality is disabled because we are not able to set the React state properly. But the algorithm is properly implemented and can be used in the future development.
5. Trash can icon on the notecard does not work.
